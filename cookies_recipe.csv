Recipe for Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies
"1/2 cup coconut oil, solid (be sure it is not melted at all)"
"1 and 1/4 cups light brown sugar, packed"
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
"1/4 cup coconut milk (I like to use the thicker Thai variety, but any coconut milk will work)"
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (be sure not to pack your flour)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
"2 cups chocolate chips (use vegan chocolate chips if vegan), divided"
"Flaky sea salt, optional"
